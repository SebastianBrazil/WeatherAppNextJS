Weather App Rebuild

Designed in 1920 by 1080 px, and 425 by 700px. This is a weather app, built in Next.js. While considered a rebuild, it is using a different style template as the previous weather app that was created. 

3/22/24: Created the weber app Next.js files. Added the background.
3/25/24: Added some text. Was looking over old Weather API assignment - never actually finished it, though it was generally functional.
3/26/24 pt 1: Added the city search for the front page. Next is the onClick function to get the data.
3/26/24 pt 2: Added some styling to the front page.
3/26/24 pt 3: Prepared some code to call on the weather API proper.
3/27/24: Added more styling and preperation to call on the Weather API
3/28/24 pt 1: fixed an error that was preventing data from updating properly
3/28/24 pt 2: Have all of my data that should show on the current day API call populating. 
3/29/24 pt 1: Completed styling of all implemented components as well as added the function to switch between temperature types. Next step is favorites, then the 5 day forecast, then mobile version.
3/29/24 pt 2: Added the favorites functions.
3/29/24 pt 3: Added the 5 day forecast. All that's left is responsiveness.
3/29/24 pt 4: Worked on responsiveness, primarily on additional desktop resolutions. The idea is to see what needs to be modified for the mobile.
