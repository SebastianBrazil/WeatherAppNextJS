Weather App Rebuild

Designed in 1920 by 1080 px, and 425 by 700px. This is a weather app, built in Next.js. While considered a rebuild, it is using a different style template as the previous weather app that was created. 

3/22/24: Created the weber app Next.js files. Added the background.
3/25/24: Added some text. Was looking over old Weather API assignment - never actually finished it, though it was generally functional.
3/26/24 pt 1: Added the city search for the front page. Next is the onClick function to get the data.
3/26/24 pt 2: Added some styling to the front page.
3/26/24 pt 3: Prepared some code to call on the weather API proper.
3/27/24: Added more styling and preperation to call on the Weather API
3/28/24 pt 1: fixed an error that was preventing data from updating properly
3/28/24 pt 2: Have all of my data that should show on the current day API call populating. 
3/29/24 pt 1: Completed styling of all implemented components as well as added the function to switch between temperature types. Next step is favorites, then the 5 day forecast, then mobile version.
3/29/24 pt 2: Added the favorites functions.
3/29/24 pt 3: Added the 5 day forecast. All that's left is responsiveness.
3/29/24 pt 4: Worked on responsiveness, primarily on additional desktop resolutions. The idea is to see what needs to be modified for the mobile.
3/29/24 pt 5: Finished mobile, done.

Thoughts:
+ The styling is cool, but the background doesn't really match the rest of your design. The icons you're using are very cartoony, so maybe a more cartoony background would fit better with the theme you're going for. I wish I was getting more "at a glance" information with your design, but I still like the direction you went with your app. I think it's missing a little pizzazz. I wasn't able to break anything, other than entering a location that doesn't exist. Overall, good job!

Likes:
+ I like the features you added for scroll to the top and unit conversion. Having the wind speed units change is a nice touch.
+ I love the autocomplete function on the search bar, that's very cool!
+ I like that I can search from the favorites menu.
+ Adding and removing favorites is very smooth. When I add a city to favorites and then immediately remove that city from favorites from within the favorites menu, the star turns gray on the homepage instantly.

Nice to haves:
+ It would be nice if there was some sort of alert or notification when the user searches for a location that is invalid or does not exist. You could add a try catch to your fetch to add an alert to accomplish that.
+ A geolocation feature would be neat as well.
+ I think you need a little bit of padding on your five day section between the rain and humidity values so everything is spaced evenly.
+ Mobile responsiveness would also be great. I'd love to see how you style that since your desktop design is so unique.
